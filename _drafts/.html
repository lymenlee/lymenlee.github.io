<p>GESTURE USER INTERFACE WHITE PAPER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>With the rise of mobile and touch-enabled mobile computing devices become more prevalent，people are demanding a more natural, comfortable and ubiquitous way to interact with their many devices. While touch starts to show its limitations on filling this role, gesture recognition technology emerges as the answer to all the questions. Imimteck has been driving the technology in this area for over 10 years, and its gesture UI solution is ready for the prime time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p><b>Prevalence of ‘Touch UI’ raise the bar of user experience</b></p>
<p>Touch has been there for many years, yet it only gets popular after the introduction of Apple’s iPhone and its Multi-Touch UI. Today, almost all smartphones and tablets use touch as their main way of user interaction. We can see people using fingers to touch their phones or tablet screens everywhere. People feels more comfortable to directly manipulate the on-screen objects instead of using keyboard or mouse to do it. It’s obvious that people are gravitated to more natural and easier ways to use their devices. People already have a good taste of ‘touch’, yet their yearning for more comfortable interaction still remains, if not becomes stronger.</p>
<p><b>Meanwhile, content is moving away from text and to multimedia tiles/blocks.  </b></p>
<p>From the quick success of Instagram and Pinterest to Facebook’s new News Feed design, from Microsoft’s tile-based Modern UI to the new ‘flat design’ trends, content organization and presentation is moving from a text and link based layout toward a more ‘flat’ and ‘direct’ tile-based structure.</p>
<p>Tiles (mostly photo tiles) are intrinsically superior than texts or links when it comes to user experience. Tiles are more graphical and engaging, which increase stickiness of the contents. Tiles can be easily organized together to foster people’s ‘location memory’. With proper design (good padding and alignment etc.), tile-based contents can avoid ‘cognition overload’ issue most text based content cannot.</p>
<p>‘Good old’ keyboard and mouse end up not ‘good’ enough and definitely ‘old’ for this new trend. Touch via people’s finger is a much better way, but also has some limitations.</p>
<p><b>As popular as ‘Touch’ is, it’s still not the answer</b></p>
<p>Touch becomes popular because it breaks people’s dependency on keyboard and mouse, now the only thing people need to interact with is the screen itself. This makes interacting with computing devices much simpler. Touch also establishes a direct and natural connection between what you do and what happens on-screen, thus moves from WYSIWYG to ‘What You <b>Do</b> Is What You Get’.</p>
<p>Yet, relying solely on touching the screen also means user are ‘<b>glued</b>’ to the screen. User’s finger needs to move within a two dimensional flat surface, which is very limiting on a lot of ways. User won’t be able to move his body too far away from the screen, user’s finger needs to travel long distance to get the job done, worse even, on vertical screens user will have to overcome the weight of the arm to do every operation, also known as the ‘gorilla arm’ issue.</p>
<p>Both the content and the people consuming the content demand a more natural, comfortable and flexible way of interaction. People already ‘cut the cord’ of their device, the next step will be to ‘scratch the glue’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Where we are and what’s wrong</b></p>
<p><b>PC needs help in a ‘post-PC era’</b></p>
<p>With the rise of tablet and smartphone, comes the fall of PC. According to a recent IDC report, PC shipments are predicted to continue decline for second year in a row. In tech industry and media, ‘tablet’, ‘mobile’, ‘smartphone’ become the new buzz words, while PC seldom made headline these days. It’s losing people’s mindshare also. But what exactly happened?</p>
<p><i>Touch happened.</i> And with touch, a variety of new touch-enabled devices are eating PC’s breakfast, especially on the content consuming side. People realized that their main usage for PC is to read email, browse Internet, check friends’ photos etc., and they don’t actually need a PC to do these (content consumption). A tablet can also do it well, and because of touch, it’s actually easier and more comfortable. The learning curve for tablet is much flatter than PC too. An 8 year old kid can pick up a tablet and start using it as fast as his 80 years old grandma.</p>
<p>So what can help PC out of this downward spiral? Touch seems to be the logical answer. Microsoft’s new ‘Surface’ tablet can run Windows 8 OS on both tile-based touch friendly mode and traditional keyboard-mouse mode. Unfortunately, this approach got quite some negative feedback on usability. Touch, as successful as it is for smaller screens, doesn’t seem to scale well on larger screens.</p>
<p><b>‘Touch’ and big screen: 5 signs of a bad ‘marriage’</b></p>
<p>Touch works great on smaller screens, where users can easily hold in their hands and bring everywhere. But when the screen becomes larger, touch starts to show limitations:</p>
<p><b>Gorilla Arm Issue</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the bigger screens are vertically seated on the desk. Like Steve Jobs once said in an interview:</p>
<p><i>“We’ve done tons of user testing on this, and it turns out it doesn’t work. Touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical. It gives great demo, but after a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off.”  </i>This is also called the ‘Gorilla Arm’ issue. Touch cannot work well with vertical screens. <i>      </i></p>
<p><b>Cost of Arm Travel</b></p>
<p>For smaller screens, doing touch doesn’t involve arm traveling. User only needs to move their finger around, which only uses their finger joint. But for bigger screens, more joints are involved, thus more burdensome doing touch will become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Illustration of joints involved in different devices.</p>
<p>So it’s obvious that users will have to use their entire arm to do touch on bigger screens like TV. The steep cost of arm travel on touch will keep most users away.</p>
<p><b>Greasy Screen Issue</b></p>
<p>Greasy screen issue is not a laptop only issue. Tablet and smartphone also suffers from it. But user’s expectation is different here. For smartphone and tablet, people are putting fingers on it from day one, so it’s not a new issue for them. Also since the screen is smaller, the grease or finger prints aren’t too obvious, while for the bigger screen on laptop, they are easier to spot. Yes, users can use some laptop detergent kit to clean the screen, but it came nowhere near the convenience of rubbing the screen clean on user’s jeans.</p>
<p><b>Cost Scaling Challenge</b></p>
<p>Thanks to the economy of scale, small touch screen has commoditized. Unfortunately it isn’t the case for big screens. For a 12 inch screen, touch and non-touch has a $120 to $150 cost difference. For bigger screens like Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface Table, the price tag is $8400. This will become less of an issue when the economy of scale kicks in, but it’s extra investment that OEM needs to put in to make things happen.</p>
<p><b>Hard to ‘Lean Back’</b></p>
<p>When read emails or news, watch videos or browsing the web, people tend to ‘lean back’ instead of ‘lean in’. Because content consuming is immersive, people want to be comfortable and relaxing. This is why tablet is so hot as a content consuming device. It allows user to lean back on their comfy couch while watching their favorite TV episodes. Bur for bigger screens which users can’t carry it with them like a tablet, it require users to lean in to touch the screen to fast forward or pause/resume. This breaks the immersive experience immediately. Having to physically touch the screen makes it hard to ‘lean back’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TV experience desperately needs to be reinvented.</b></p>
<p>Compare to the speed of innovation in the mobile industry, TV is rather stale. The way people watch TV hasn’t changed for many years: People sitting on their couch wielding 100 remotes trying to find the channel they want. Remotes are easily displaced or lost. We’ve all experienced the frustration of looking left and right trying to find the correct remote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Illustration of ‘Remote Throne’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not making things better, the introduction of ‘Smart TV’ only adds more complexity into the mix. Since most smart TV support widgets and letting user browse the Internet, all of a sudden, the unwieldy remote get even less useful. The remote is just not designed to efficiently navigate and interact with a modern tile based smart TV user interface.  Google even partnered with Logitech to build a full keyboard-remote for their Google TV, only canceled the product later because people don’t like using keyboard on their couch.</p>
<p>The proliferation of digital content are driving a smarter and more connected TV, but the old way of interaction is holding everyone back. A better and more natural way of interaction need to be invented to solve the <b>billion</b> dollar problem, consider how big the TV industry is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Solution: Gesture UI</b></p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to the development of 3D gesture recognition technology, a brand new way of interaction emerges to fit perfectly in the gap. In 2010, Microsoft released its Kinect sensor device for its XBOX 360 game console. It uses a webcam to capture user’s body movements, and allow user to control and interact with the XBOX 360 by simply moving their body and speaking the voice commands. By February 2013, over 24 millions Kinect devices have been shipped worldwide. The success of Kinect paved the way for gesture UI to become main stream. It proved the concept, educated the market and evolved the technology to be ready for more serious applications out side of gaming. It shown that valuable and popular user experience can be imagined as more natural user input technologies are introduced.</p>
<p><b>Why gesture is the answer?</b></p>
<p>Here’s five reasons why gesture is THE solution we’ve been looking for to fill the gap:</p>
<p><b>Standing on the shoulder of ‘Touch’</b></p>
<p>People learn to use touch devices very quickly. Give a tablet to an 8 years old and within 5 minutes, he is playing Angry Bird without any hand-holding. This is because touch is a natural user interface, it uses people’s body for the interaction. You don’t ‘learn’ it, you just ‘do’ it. The same could be applied to gesture. Actually, gesture UI borrows a lot from touch, the only difference is you don’t need to stick your finger on the screen. Instead, you can lean back, and just move your finger in whichever pose you feel comfortable. Anyone familiar with touch can use gesture UI in no time.</p>
<p><b>Lean back, relax, and make yourself comfortable</b></p>
<p>For many years, ergonomic has taken us a long way on optimizing our body postures when using digital devices. It might not be needed any more if we use gesture UI. Since you are freed from screen, keyboard or mouse, you can just lean back, relax, be comfortable and still get the job done by simply moving fingers around. Well designed user interface and 3D motion sensors will do the heavy lifting, leaving you the freedom of creativity and productivity to the users.</p>
<p><b>Clean view on a clean screen</b></p>
<p>Gestures can be recognized at a distance, which means no finger contact on the screen needed. You don’t have to worry about a greasy screen like touch. Also, your hands won’t have to get close to the screen and block your line of sight (and immersive experience). You get a clean view all the time.</p>
<p><b>Bigger screen, same cost</b></p>
<p>Unlike touch, no matter how big or how small your screen is, the gesture sensor and software used remain the same. You don’t have to spend extra dollars to enjoy gesture on bigger screens. With the future support of gesture enabling accessaries, more flexibilities can also be easily achieved.</p>
<p><b>‘Cool’ factor</b></p>
<p>Though people get their first taste of gesture recognition on Kinect, the concept itself is not an unfamiliar one. Many sci-fi movies used gesture manipulation to showcase futuristic technology. ‘Minority Report’, ‘Iron Man’, ‘Avatar’, ‘Matrix’, ‘Firefly’ are the more famous ones of them. All these movies helped to drive up the hype and add up to the ‘cool’ factor of gesture control. People familiar with these movies will to embrace the new technology rather than back away from it. This will make the early adoption of gesture UI easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Imimtek’s Gesture UI Solution</b></p>
<p>Imimtek’s gesture UI solution is designed from top down with a focus on user experience. With a solid user experience in mind, proper gesture user interfaces are designed and enabling technologies developed to work as a whole, offering smooth, natural and innovative ways of interaction. Specifically, Imimtek’s gesture UI solution comes with the following features that makes it a perfect fit for the challenges mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gesturing at any distance</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imimtek’s gesture UI solution has a great sensing volume. The airspace between user and device range from 5cm to 5 meters. The sensing volume can be further expanded when better lens and camera become commoditized. This covers scenarios from close and intimate personal smartphone usage to mid-distance and casual home theatre experience. The device will recognize user’s gestures from any distance, and user has the freedom to just lean back and take control with the move of their fingers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution for the rest of us</b></p>
<p>Imimtek’s gesture UI solution is developed to be consumer-oriented from day one. The hardware requirements is modest compare to other solutions. Gesture recognition is still no trivial computing, especially on smartphones where CPU horsepower and power consumption are limited. Yet thanks to the development on smartphone chipsets, 4-core and 8-core CPUs are making their way into the main stream devices. Imimtek’s solution can also utilize GPU (Graphic Processor Unit) instead of APU (Application Processor Unit) for the computing, which increase the  power efficiency per block of operations.</p>
<p>This opens doors to a variety of devices from smartphone to smart TV, without worrying about CPU performance or power consumption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Precise Finger Tip Recognition</b></p>
<p>Finger recognition is an organic part of the solution. This enables the device to easily track finger tip movement, offering a similar experience to touch (also using finger tip for the interaction). Being able to recognize user body movement on the finger level minimizes user’s arm travel, avoids ‘Gorilla arm’ problem, and eventually lets users to simply sit back and move only their fingers for the interaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>No high-end camera, no problem</b></p>
<p>Imimtek uses commoditized camera as the gesture sensor. Leveraging the recent development on smartphone cameras and lenses, Imimtek’s gesture UI solution can achieve incredible precision with very low cost. The small size of the cameras also offers form factor flexibility. They can be easily embedded into laptop, set-top boxes, or TVs without adding much cost or size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Any background, any environment</b></p>
<p>Imimtek’s gesture UI solution utilizes a ‘per frame’ instead of ‘inter-frame’ algorithm for the recognition, thus it is intrinsically immune to changing background (not like some other solutions which the sensor needs to facing up to the ceiling). The gesture recognition just works in any environment without requirements on specific ‘backdrop’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Robust </b></p>
<p>Unlike other solutions that uses finger shadows or point-cloud,  Imimtek uses computer vision and machine learning to understand features in the user and environment, Imimtek’s solution processes natural color video data just like human eyes. It doesn’t get confused by other objects in view, and is therefore robust and reliable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Ready Made Gesture User Interface</b></p>
<p>Imimteck’s solution comes with a highly tailored user interface to optimize feedback while gesturing. First demo will be on Windows 8.  (need to delve deeper.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>‘A’ team with proven track record</b></p>
<p>Imimtek is a startup that develops next-generation natural user interfaces for mobile and desktop devices. Founders of Imimtek are also founders of Canesta, which produced the highest performance 3D ToF image sensor in the industry. Canesta was later acquired by Microsoft XBOX BU and used its technology on the Kinect project.</p>
