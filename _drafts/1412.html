<p>I did some research and also talked with my colleagues in ZTE. Anritsu is a decent company and I'm also interested in the position, which would demand the combination skills set of  my technical background, marketing experience and standard organization corporation (TIA).  Please find the attachment as my updated resume. Thanks for your help!</p>
