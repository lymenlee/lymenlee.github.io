<p>With Sony's Playstation 4 media event, the next generation of game console once again became the new buzz around. Microsoft is suppose to join the party and has its own event for XBOX 720 in the near future. Here are some things I wish they will talk about:</p>
<p>1. Merge between console (Xbox 720) and PC (Windows 8)</p>
<p>Could that happen? It would be great if an Win8 PC can play some Xbox games. And that will add some appeal to the gamers. </p>
<p>2. </p>
