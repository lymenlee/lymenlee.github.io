    End up becoming\nJot down\nHis lovely English wife \n... Great read that gets
    stronger after act one. I like the very personal relational tone that describes
    your interaction with A and the products. \nIf there is a lack, it is Steve himself,
    but I like that his product and company represent him. What about iPad? What about
    Pixar?\n\";}}}"

<p>It's been some days since Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs passed away. I've been reading a lot of the tribute and memorial posts about Steve, Apple, tech innovation and all, but I didn't remember coming across one that discussed how and why a clueless PC person could end up become a die-hard Apple fanboy. I want to jog down my experience on becoming a fanboy of Apple and Steve Jobs . You know, it's to say good bye to Steve, and to move on knowing what we gained and lost.</p>
<p>Lv 0:  First Encounter</p>
<p>My first contact with Apple product was in my college days. I was studying in a university in Shanghai, China. The campus is in suburban area and I was living a frugal life. I had two uncles both live in the downtown Shanghai, so I developed a habit of visiting them over the weekend. You know the drill, get some nice food and wondering around just to pretend I'm still a city boy.  Anyway, one of the uncle just came back from England and he is a accomplished architecture designer and just started his own business. Busy balancing from the pressure and burden of a first time entrepreneur and a new family with her lovely English wife, he didn't have much time for me. The great thing is, he knew and trust I can handle myself and knew I wouldn't care a bit if he didn't put most of his time and attention on me. I really appreciated that. So most of the time when I visited, he would say :"Hey welcome! I have some other stuff but here's the Mac, you can use it to do whatever you want. Food is in the fridge. Do help yourself, will you?" So I did. I tried every single application installed on that Mac and told him :</p>
<p>'It's a beautiful machine but not a lot of softwares!'</p>
<p>"Yeah, you mean games.'</p>
<p>'Yep.'</p>
<p>Then he'll go ahead and explain that Mac is a rather 'niche' computer most popular in the creative community and not widely adopted by the crowd. That's why not a lot of software developer develop apps for them.</p>
<p>'What a pity...' he said, 'maybe it will change one day.'</p>
<p>'Maybe it will.' I replied. 'But I'll still use my PC for games' I told myself.</p>
<p>Oh how naive I was back then.</p>
<p>Lv 1: Fashion Chaser</p>
<p>I've always been loving music. Mostly pop and a bit R&amp;R. The machine I used then was a Sony Walkman. I really liked it. It accompanied me through all those chilly winters and hot summers. The only downside is that it's too clumsy to carrying around. Lazy like me, it's great price I have to pay to have my favorite music around. This is changed when I got my first iPod. I instantly fall in love with this little device. I've used other digital music devices but nothing is like this little monster. It holds a lot of songs and very pocketable. I never have any problem figuring out how to use it. And the quality is very solid too, feels solid in hand but still has an edge.  Everything works as I expected them to. 'This is quite a device' I said to a friend of mine, 'I can use it without reading the user manual!'. He snapped, ' Like you EVER read ANY user manual.'. 'Never.' I smirked. So I carried this iPod around the campus. Every time I walk pass a Walkman carrier, I had a secret feeling that I'm cooler and different, my earbud color is white and ALL OTHERS's are black. How ugly the black color looked! Can't understand anyone would tolerate it!</p>
<p>As you can see, I'm experiencing my first level of Apple fanboiness: I love Apple products, but that Apple products makes me look good better matters more to me. I still love myself the most.</p>
<p>Lv 2: Rational Justifier</p>
<p>The time I really developed my understanding of what Apple stands for and what their vision is was after I immigrated to US. I am a student no more, have worked in telecom and wireless industry for 10 years and have seen a lot and experienced a lot. I developed my circuit boards,  had my fair share of coding, won some million dollars telecom contracts for the company and travelled a lot. Being more mature and knowledgable, I still use my iPod but didn't feel anything special about it anymore, still kept my distance with Macs. I occasionally wonder into Apple store and play around a bit, but nothing fundamentally different for me.</p>
<p>It all changed on June 2007. I was accompany a customer back to China with my boss and the customer just bought an iPhone. He  seems to like it a lot, so we subtly brought this up and ask about his opinion on it. His eyes brightened, instead of talk about how he feels, he showed us how things work on iPhone and how it's so different. We were amazed by the multi-touch interface and how interesting the pinch-to-zoom works, 'magical' is the word that came to my mind. The UI looks very 'clean', like an well crafted artwork instead of a mass market consumer electronic product. It blows my mind away. And this device can even get on the Internet and still didn't hurt my eyes after half an hour of reading! Being a news junkie at that time, I realized that this is the perfect device for me. I gotta get it!</p>
<p>Going back to US, the company went through a pretty big re-org and I was moved to another department doing handset business development and product management. Here I met my 'Apple Mentor'(I believe he is in lv 3 then, ^^) and with his help, bought my first iPhone (still keep it till today). He was a long time Apple user, worked in Nokia as product manager and always been an Apple fan. We spent hours after hours discussing Apple's history, its product philosophy, its attention to details, and enormously thoughts they put into the product design. We were inspired and applied all these ideas stemming from our 'Apple discussion' into our own products. After two years of work together, we cracked most of the US tier 1 carriers, sold our products in millions. I began to really become a mental apprentice of Apple. I learned what is perfectionism, why user interface and user experience matters, I laughed when watching 'Get a Mac' series commercials, I was inspired and totally fascinated by Steve's keynotes, I understood what is RDF (Reality Distortion Field), I watched Steve Jobs' Stanford Commencement Speech 10+ times, the list goes on and on. I was like a sponge, absorbing anything related to Apple and it's magical leader. People say the '10,000 hours rule' for athletes applies to other areas too. I wonder how many hours I spent on studying Apple's product, it's way of handling product development, its engineering/product dominating culture, it's marketing brilliance and above all, it's leader's great vision. It's safe to say that the time I spent on studying Apple and its approach to product design greatly improved my wits and ability to develop my own products. And I began to gradually develop my own vision, on the mobile industry, on business, on life. I felt like a new world was opened its door to me, and the key is a company called Apple and the guide a guy named Steve.</p>
<p>I began to talk with other people trying to share my finding, trying to make them see. That's when people starts to call me 'Apple fanboy'. Hmm, I would take it as a compliment I guess.</p>
<p>Lv 3: True believer</p>
<p>Allow me to excerpt a twitter I read the other day. It was a tweet about Apple's new iPhone 4S AI Siri's smart response. It goes like this:</p>
<p>Me: 'Siri, what is the best smartphone in the world?'</p>
<p>Siri: 'There is other smartphones?'</p>
<p>Very few people reached this high, or put it another way, dig that deep a hole for themselves and still enjoy it. Cause the pre-requisite is too high for most people. You need to emotionally like Apple products(Lv 1), then rationally understands Apple's approach(Lv 2), if you're lucky, you figure out what you yourself really want to do and achieve and it happens to echoes what Apple have been walking the talk all along, then congratulations, you're level 3, a true believer. You know who you are, you know what Apple are, and you know which direction you'll go in terms of work, career, life. It's not about 'other smartphones', it's about you. How good you can be for yourself. You'll also know how hard Apple's approach could be, and how much more rewarding it can be. But you know that you're not alone. You'll truly appreciate what Apple stands for, what Steve Jobs has been so bravely practiced for so many years and succeeded in so grand a scale. You'll understand how lucky you're to be in the same era of Apple's demise and resurrection, to witness and even be part of history.</p>
<p>Then and only then, you'll understand what a great loss Steve Jobs' pass away was to human being as a whole. Like my 'Apple mentor' puts it:</p>
<p>'We lost a true legend."</p>
<p>R.I.P. Steve Jobs.</p>
