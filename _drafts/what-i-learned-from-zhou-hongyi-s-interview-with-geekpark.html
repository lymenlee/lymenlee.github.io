<p>I believe Zhou is a clear thinker. He saw it very clearly that for a product to be successful, it will and need to have a 'hard demands', not soft demand, or even fake demands. Demand should come from your targeted market, not from the elite small group of IT guys. Figure out what annoys people and solve the problem. Or do the same thing cheaper, or do the same thing less painful all will stack up to your chance of success.<br />
He also talk about Tencent. I really like his comments which goes 'Who is Tencent's product manager? We all are. Cause whatever we innovate, they will analyze and absorb and with their R&amp;D power as well as experience, they can quickly copy and develop something even better, coupled with their strong marketing platform, they will gain traction in a much greater way small companies can never dream of. So keep your low profile and stay under their radar for at lease 2-3 years is the only way out for innovative small companies. Elite Superstar team like MI UI also failed due to the exact reason. The future is dire, but it's the reality every product manager should face.</p>
