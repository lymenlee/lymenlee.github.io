<p><strong>Hey I'm Michael Li.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a Product Manager specialized in User Interface and User Experience for mobile apps and web apps. Live and work in US but grew up in China, I often find myself switching perspectives when looking at things. I don't know how to describe the feeling but it's pretty amazing, and often give unique inspirations for the technical and design challenges we're facing in mobile industry. I'll try to share those feelings and insights with you here. My writing will be focusing on user interface, user experience, design thinking and tech trends, with a bit 'oriental favor' hopefully.</p>
<p>Feel free to leave comments! I love quality discussion more than quality writing.</p>
