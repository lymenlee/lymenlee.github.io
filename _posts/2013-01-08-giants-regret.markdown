Nokia has recently confirmed in an interview that they won't rule out Android' as a future OS option just yet. Very interesting development in the mobile industry indeed.

Some said that the move for Nokia to partner with Microsoft (which at that time had no proven success in mobile, no ecosystem strength) is a misstep in the first place. The development we saw today may just be the hard facts starting to kick in. Things might be different should Microsoft and Nokia move faster and deliver more, but for two giants like they are, I'm not surprised they haven't  managed more.  The entire tech industry's shift to mobile happens not only in technology front, but also in mind-set. Being mobile means you'll have to move faster (have more products delivered per year), be more creative (some time as destructive as Apple), be more flexible (enter Samsung, with their hundreds of different types of handsets released per year), to even survive.

Having said that, I still think there's hope for the Microsoft-Nokia duo:

**1. Windows OS is unique in experience**

No matter how Android fans try to defend it, the Android OS offer similar if not inferior experience like iOS. But Windows  Modern UI (used to be Metro UI, they changed the term to avoid trademark problem) is totally designed from ground up to be unique and it's a well thought out design at that. The Windows experience feels more 'fluidly' in using (surprise surprise!) thanks to all the smooth and cool screen transition animations. The interface is very minimalistic and easy to use, a breath of fresh air on the look and feel of the heavily-chromed Android/iOS UI and fits into Nokia's conventional UI style quite well. Even the most die-hard Apple fan boy can't accuse Windows Modern UI being a copycat.

**2. Windows OS is patent-infringement proof**

The entire industry is keeping a close eye on the ongoing Samsung's 'lawsuit of the century' with Apple, and the attention is very well deserved. Because it will carve out the future shape of mobile OS landscape. If OEMs end up needing to pay a high loyalty fee to use Android OS, then suddenly Microsoft become very appealing as an alternative. Not all company has the deep pocket and thick face to go into a huge law suit war with Apple like Samsung did.

**3. Scale wise, Microsoft-Nokia is the only candidate to compete with the Google-Samsung duo.**

Scale still counts these days. Without Google's influence on Internet and Samsung's huge business machine on developing and delivering hundreds of devices per year, Android won't be at the place they are today. To match it, similar scale is almost a must. (Look at Palm's 'downfall' as a proof of this point, they have all the correct ingredients, just not big enough to push for ecosystem penetration to a tipping point. ) Combining Nokia's market share and reputation on mobile device and Microsoft's influence (mind share) on desktop OS, they definitely should be able to compete head to head with anyone.

Whatever Nokia or Microsoft want to do, they must act fast and don't ever look back. Nokia might be the no.1 mobile device manufacturer and Microsoft the no.1 desktop OS, but those are history and holds very little credit on a fast paced, ever-changing mobile industry.
