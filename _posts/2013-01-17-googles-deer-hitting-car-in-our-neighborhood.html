Well, not exactly the same car of cause, but fearsome all the same! If you don't know the story yet, <a title="Google maps car hits a deer, records it all. Oh deer" href="http://www.neowin.net/news/google-maps-car-hits-a-deer-records-it-all" target="_blank">here</a> is the link to it.<br />
There are always controversies with the Google Street View Cars. People love Google Maps, especially the street view feature, makes it easier to find the places you've never been to before. But people also don't want Google sniffing around their neighborhood. (Aside from taking street view panorama photos, they also collects WiFi information) That's why when <a title="Google maps car hits a deer, records it all. Oh deer" href="http://www.neowin.net/news/google-maps-car-hits-a-deer-records-it-all" target="_blank">things like this happens</a>, it went viral instantly.<br />
This is the first time I saw a Google Map Street View car in action. I have to say it's kinda cool. See that blue sphere on top of the pole? I believe that's the panorama camera they use. And the car is painted with a Google Map on it!</p>
