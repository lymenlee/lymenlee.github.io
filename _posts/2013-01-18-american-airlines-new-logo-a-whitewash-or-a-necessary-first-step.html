<p>American <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57564520/american-airlines-introduces-new-logo/" target="_blank">announced</a> this week that they will have a brand new design of logo, livery and other paint jobs. The design itself is actually pretty good, modern and stylish. But after reading the news, my initial feeling isn't excitement, I actually feel angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/american-airlines-new-logo_270x203.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-537" alt="American-Airlines-new-logo_270x203" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/american-airlines-new-logo_270x203.jpg" width="270" height="203" /></a><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">Image: American Airline's New Logo via </span><a style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57564520/american-airlines-introduces-new-logo/" target="_blank">CBS</a></p>
<p>Why? Because of all the problems they have, all the things they didn't get right, all the delay, lost of luggage, bad services, they choose to solve a non-issue of re-branding? <a href="http://247wallst.com/2013/01/18/american-airlines-new-paint-job-a-whitewash/" target="_blank">24/7 Wall St</a> has a pretty accurate articles of AA's more pressing issues, which I won't repeat it here. The point is, I felt like they are focusing on the wrong direction.</p>

<p>From basic branding 101 we know that your branding is only as good as your product. Now the problem is the service that AA offer is less competitive, not the brand itself has any issues. If a business man's flight get delayed for 12 hours, no new fancy livery would make him less angry, simple as that. We live in a world of advertisements, of non-stopping PR campaigns, of endless corporate promises that never get fulfilled. We're tired of them all. Just give us something real, something we can feel comfortable put our trust in. Yet what we got now? A new logo? Seriously?</p>
