<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/the-windows-first-mobile-strategy-for-microsoft-office-2013-is-not-working/" title="Microsoft: To be or not to be">Microsoft: To be or not to be</a></p>
<p>The prior success of Microsoft Office relies heavily on the dominance of Windows operating system on desktop, and also on the dominance of desktop as THE platform for people to create and consume content. </p>
<p><strong>Those days are long gone. </strong></p>
<p>Now everything (read all the money) is going mobile and this is time to reshuffle the deck, everything company should have their mobile strategy in place and start executing, in order to get ahead of the game. Microsoft is lagging behind on vision due to their heavy legacy, and further slow on executing due to bureaucracy. Windows OS and Office are their bread and butter two money makers, they can't afford to lose them. Windows 8 already shown sign of struggle because of the mixed user interface, now if Office also starts to slow down, I don't know what they still have?</p>
<p>Xbox?</p>
