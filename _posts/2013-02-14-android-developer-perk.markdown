Let me make this crystal clear,

**every App purchase you make on Google Play gives the developer your name, suburb and email address with no indication that this information is actually being transferred**</blockquote>


I can't say this is totally unexpected. There are so many privacy leaks everywhere. And the only way to not get spammed or exploited is to not give out your email information at all.

However, the impact of this privacy issue could be huge. People could getÂ stalkered for leaving negative rating of an app they don't like on Google Play, or being the victim of email spam. Developers don't really need these private information and Google obviously gains nothing from it. I hope Google could show some respect to user's privacy and stop this ASAP. They don't want an unnecessary push on the fine '[Creepy Line](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100005766/eric-schmidt-getting-close-to-the-creepy-line/)' they are carefully walking, don't they?
