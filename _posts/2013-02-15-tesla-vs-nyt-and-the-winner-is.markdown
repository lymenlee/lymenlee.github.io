Generally I think it’s a good thing that everyone could have their voices. People will listen to both sides of the story and make their own judgement. And usually the more you discuss and dig something, the closer it will be for the public to come to the truth.
I was reading most of the comments on this NYT vs Tesla drama from different websites. Some offer photos, some provide perspectives, I can compare all these and figure out the big picture easier than with only NYT’s article and Tesla’s blog. I felt empowered. That. Is the most important implication to me from this. The public is empowered eventually.

So in the era of media democratization, our readers are the biggest winner.
