<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;"><a href="http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/stylistic_s01_front_fr.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1105" alt="stylistic_s01_front_fr" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/stylistic_s01_front_fr.png" width="240" height="448" /></a>Fujitsu recently launched its first Android based smartphone with France Telecom. I know there's nothing 'exciting' to blog about, but there're some serious implications from it, just like people can tell the fall is coming from the falling of a leaf. </span></p>
<p><strong>1. Accessibility to a whole new level.</strong></p>
<p>Every UI/UX designer should take accessibility into consideration these days, but in most cases people do it just to conform to regulation requirements. It has never be in the center of the design stage before. But by choosing to release its first smartphone as a senior oriented phone with unique features and user interface, Fujitsu made a serous commitment to accessibility, from regulation abiding level to business sell point level. There are cold numeric business calculation behind it yes, but it's still heart warming to see seniors are targeted and well thought out designs are making their use of smartphone much easier. Seniors want a piece in the mobile trend also!</p>
<p><strong>2. Android OEMs start to tap into niche market already</strong></p>
<p>This is something where iOS ecosystem is lagging behind actually. Don't get me wrong. iPhone is still very popular and I'd even say it's still main stream and leading the innovation. But on niche markets, they are not making much progress. Reason? Simple. Because Apple is but ONE company and they release but ONE phone per year. This is a pretty hard limitation. Yet for Android, there is always your ambitious 'new comers' want to do something different to strike from different angle, thus the senior demographic targeting Fujitsu. If you ask an elderly which phone he will use, a dedicated designed senior phone or iPhone with some accessibility enhancements. I don't think the answer will be too hard to guess.</p>
<p><strong>3. Flexible UI Themes for iOS to close the gap</strong></p>
<p>Yet hope is not all lost for iOS ecosystem. When Steve Jobs first release the iPhone, one notion he brought up in his keynote about why traditional handset OEMs did wrong is hard keyboard. He claimed that what hardware can do on one thing, software can do equally well on the same thing with one hundreds different ways. And that leads to the rise of mutli-touch technology and touch screen becoming the 'de facto' choice for phones just because it's so flexible.</p>
<p>Along the same line, the user interface potential for iOS to evolve and become more flexible to address more niche markets are huge. For example, by introducing different user interface design tweaks as different 'themes', your iPhone can actually look and feel like a senior phone, or enterprise phone, or kid phone. At the center, it's still iOS, but on the user experience level, it can be optimized for different purposes.  This has been the strength point for Android from the very beginning, ability to tweak the interface, and iOS do need to play catch up.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px;">A good start of this would be introducing 'Dashboard' of Mac OS into iOS. Put all the relevant information and widgets on top, so the 'update hungry' users can quench their thirsty in one glance. I'll try to write a separate blog on this in the future. </span></p>
<p>All in all, a move to make dedicated device for older guys is always welcomed, and I had a feeling that we'll see more of these kinds of dedicated devices in the future.</p>
