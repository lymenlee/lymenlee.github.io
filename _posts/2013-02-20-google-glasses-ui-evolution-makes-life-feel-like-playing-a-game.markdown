Google's [first Project Glasses video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4) stirred a lot of controversies because of its UI design gets in the way of people's normal life. You really can't use this gadgets in real life if the user interface is so prominent, in the middle of your view, and pop up all the time, like this:

It could even be dangerous when driving or biking. Yeah a map is good, but only if I can actually SEE the road!


[![Project-Glasses-2](http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/project-glasses-2.png?w=560)](http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/project-glasses-2.png)Today, Google releases another teaser of the highly anticipated gadget, called[ 'How it Feels (through Glasses)'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=v1uyQZNg2vE#!). This time, Google's UI actually get a total re-haul. All the UI are only limited to the top right corner of your view, getting out-of-the-way.

[![Starwar UI](http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/starwar-ui.jpg?w=560)](http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/starwar-ui.jpg)Watching the video, I totally felt like living other people's life, first person viewpoint. This could be totally amazing. We already have [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) where gamers broadcast their gameplay for others to watch. How far are we before we can broadcast our real life using Google Glasses?
