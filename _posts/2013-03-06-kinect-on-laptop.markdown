The Verge today[ has a video showcasing Microsoft's new progress in bringing Kinect to laptop/desktop as a new interaction model. ](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4069598/kinect-for-windows-hand-detection-hands-on)

This is … interesting, makes me feels like I’m playing my Xbox Kinect games. I can totally imagine using gestures to turn up volume or switch channel on my TV, but wait, aren't we also going to use this on work and stuff? Which is not as fun as playing games on Kinect. Moving my arms around like this for hours just blows my mind, especially if I’ll have to stop my arm mid-air to do the needed accuracy adjustments… felt tired already. I think this will have the [same ‘gorilla arm’ challenge as laptop with a touch screen](http://linwangge.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/uicraft-rethinking-touch-screen-on-laptop/)…

But wait, maybe there is a way out. Introducing ... the 'Hand Signs' system!
