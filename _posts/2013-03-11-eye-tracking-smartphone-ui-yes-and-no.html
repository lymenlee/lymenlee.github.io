<p>Came across this article <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/10/the-implications-of-the-interface-that-watches-you/">'The Implications Of The Interface That Watches You''</a> today. Eye-tracking as a new way of user interaction is intriguing, but after some thoughts, I think it's very limiting:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1741" align="aligncenter" width="560"]<a href="http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eye-tracking.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1741" alt="eye-tracking" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/eye-tracking.jpg?w=560" width="560" height="384" /></a> Image from: TechCrunch.com[/caption]</p>
<h2>1.  Eye movement is a' subconscious' behavior, hard to control.</h2>
<p>When we move our hands, our brain needs to command it to do it and we're aware of it. Eye movement is different. We do it unconsciously. We automatically blink when we read for a long time. We move our eye balls up and down when browsing the web without thinking about it. Now if an app or smartphone tracks our eye movements and makes the app responding to it, all these random moves will start to mess things up. User will grow nervous about their eye movements, adding HUGE pressure to the experience. A good app design should try as much as possible to NOT make user think. This is making user think MORE about something they never have to think about (eye movement) before. Totally wrong.</p>
<h2>2. Dynamically changing UI screws location memory</h2>
<p>The idea of changing the user interface based on people's eye movement is even more absurd. Location memory is in the center part of user experience design. Human brains remember where things are and  it makes it easy for them to find it next time they want to use it. Dynamically changing where all the buttons and other UI elements are? User will become utterly confused as where things are.</p>
<h2>3. Eye-tracking as data gathering tool is creepy but useful</h2>
<p>So what is the better way of using eye-tracking technology? Simply put, using the data only. Quietly gathering eye movements data without messing around the UI, and then use the gathered data for better profile building, ads targeting etc. is actually a solid idea. Before, all the profile building technology stops at search and clicks. Google knows what website you clicks or searches, that's how they build their targeting ads system that rakes in billions of ads dollars. But what if they can know which part of the screen get the most eye-balls? It's definitely a step forward, both on precision and creepiness ironically.</p>
<p>Since camera has become so ubiquitous now, technologies like facial recognizing, eye tracking, gesture tracking will trickle down to our laptop and smartphones. Give or take, welcome to an era of new interactions.</p>
