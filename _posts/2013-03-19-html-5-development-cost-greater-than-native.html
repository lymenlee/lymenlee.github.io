<p>In the article from The Next Web: <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/03/18/accounting-software-startup-xero-ditches-html5-in-favor-of-native-ios-and-android-apps/">Accounting software startup Xero ditches HTML5 in favor of native iOS and Android apps</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Our view is that HTML5 technologies can deliver as-good-as-native experiences…but the lesson from Fastbook is that it’s hard work – you don’t get those experiences out-of-the-box. And the lesson we’ve learnt over the last 12 months has been that the cost in time, effort and testing to bring an HTML5 application to a native level of performance seems to be far greater than if the application was built with native technologies from the get-go.</p></blockquote>
<p>This surprises me a bit. One big reason for app developers to choose web app approach is because HTML5 is 'cross-platform', thus developers don't have to deal with OS fragmentation and develop one version for each platform.</p>
<p>I guess this is due to immature of the ecosystem. By immature, it's not just the technology itself, but also the developer talent pool as well as the tools and resources. We all know the 'end-game' for HTML5 is great, but to get there, there seems to be more hurdles than expected...</p>
