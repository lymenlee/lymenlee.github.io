<p>Google<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/googles-keep-note-taking-web-and-android-app-gets-its-official-public-launch/"> announced the new note-taking service Google Keep today. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://linwangge.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/google-keep-icon1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image aligncenter" id="i-1810" alt="Image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/google-keep-icon1.png?w=383" width="383" height="381" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I gave the web version a try. The UI looks very minimalism, using it is easy too. There aren't many features to begin with though. It looks like just a lite, new service Google want to put on their cloud. Google didn't mention whether they have bigger vision on the service, so we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Some thoughts from a product design point of view:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1. Don't have an ecosystem.  Take Evernote as an example, they have Chrome extension 'Web Clipper', Outlook plug-in, apps on all major mobile OS, PC/MAC software and a web-app. Making note taking available everywhere. Google Keep only have Android and web-app, kind of lacking still.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2. Multimedia support. Currently  it only supports text and photo.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">3. Notes organization. I noticed that Keep lets you give a color to the note, and display the notes in 'List' view or 'Grid' view. Other than that, pretty much nothing. Maybe Google never really think about scaling? Or they want to position Google Keep as a lite note-taker instead of an information management tool?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">3. Note sharing. Without sharing, Google Keep is likely to lose the biggest demographic of note taking: students. There are plenty of opportunities that Google could embedded Keep into their social media ecosystem. Share on G+ for one, follow friends/celebrities notes for another.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;">Obviously the service is still in its infancy. It will be interesting to see how it evolves. Hopefully it won't be like Google Reader at least.</p>
