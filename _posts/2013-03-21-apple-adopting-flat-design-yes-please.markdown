There's[ report](http://macdailynews.com/2013/03/21/apple-design-teams-get-cozier-as-jony-ive-pushes-toward-a-more-flat-design-that-is-starker-simpler/) that Apple's legendary design master Jonathan Ive is leading Apple's iOS user interface toward another direction: 'flat design'.

This is really long time coming!  It's about time we get some fresh air on iOS UI. And Apple shouldn't let Microsoft steal all the thunder with Metro UI. I just can't wait to see Apple's interpretation of flat design!
