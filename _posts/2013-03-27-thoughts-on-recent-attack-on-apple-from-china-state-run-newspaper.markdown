Recently, Apple got attacked by Chinese government owned media a lot. Here's my perspectives:

Firstly, Chinese consumers pretty much know the governmental media's true color and that their claim against Apple is all lying or twisted. The recent scandal ’820 Event’ speaks it all. (more details here: [http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/03/16/apple-weibo-china-cctv/](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/03/16/apple-weibo-china-cctv/))

Secondly, government itself also knows what they are saying is bullshit. A lot of government officers, their children, family members use iPhone and they won’t use it if the service is bad. They just has an agenda and a marching order.

Lastly, over time, Chinese netizens have already developed a habit of interpreting whatever government media claims reversely. If the media claim someone is bad, then that someone must be actually good! So all the 'attacks' in effect are good PR for Apple.
