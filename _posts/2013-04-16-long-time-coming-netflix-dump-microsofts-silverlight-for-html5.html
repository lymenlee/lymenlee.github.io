<p>Due to Microsoft Silverlight's lack of support in the future, <a href="http://macdailynews.com/2013/04/16/netflix-to-dump-microsofts-silverlight-for-html5-video-streaming/" target="_blank">Netflix is moving their platform to HTML5.</a></p>
<p>Stick to an out-dated, poorly supported and proprietary plug-in isn't the way to gain edge on competition.  Netflix has been making great progress on creating its own exclusive contents like <a title="House of Cards" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/" target="_blank">House of Cards</a>. They are right on their way to the goal of 'becoming HBO sooner than HBO become us.' This move away from Silverlight to the more mobile-friendly HTML5 shows that they haven't forgotten their technical origin during the transition. </p>
<p>I look forward to any UI/UX innovation they would bring to us with the introduction of HTML5. </p>
