Due to Microsoft Silverlight's lack of support in the future, [Netflix is moving their platform to HTML5.](http://macdailynews.com/2013/04/16/netflix-to-dump-microsofts-silverlight-for-html5-video-streaming/)

Stick to an out-dated, poorly supported and proprietary plug-in isn't the way to gain edge on competition.  Netflix has been making great progress on creating its own exclusive contents like [House of Cards](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/). They are right on their way to the goal of 'becoming HBO sooner than HBO become us.' This move away from Silverlight to the more mobile-friendly HTML5 shows that they haven't forgotten their technical origin during the transition. 

I look forward to any UI/UX innovation they would bring to us with the introduction of HTML5.
