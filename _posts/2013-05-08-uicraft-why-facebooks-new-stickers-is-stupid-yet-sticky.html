<p>Following <a title="New Path 3.0, New Path to Monetization" href="http://linwangge.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/new-path-3-0-new-path-to-monetization/" target="_blank">Path's step</a>, Facebook recently introduced a sticker feature in their messaging experience. Stickers are a glorified version of 'emojis' which user can send to their friend while chatting to express emotions. It usually comes with a package of different expressions/emotions. All Facebook's current stickers are free to download, but the 'Free' tag could very quickly become '$0.99' like most Path stickers do.</p>

<p>Stickers are no new creation by Facebook at all. A bunch of Asian messaging apps and services have already embraced it for some time. This whole 'cuteness' thing might seem silly, yet before you shout 'stupid and cheesy!', let's not forget all the 'stupid' videos that got millions visits on YouTube. There is something behind all these 'stupid yet popular' fads. Most of them share one treats: They play very well to your emotion. And emotion, my friend, is usually our weakness. That is what's behind all these impulse purchasing, all these 'my brain tries to say no but my body screams YES' moments, all those 'this is so stupid but I just can't stop laughing' videos.</p>
<p>This is also why some  apps are successful in creating attractive experience. Enter '<a title="Clear app" href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/" target="_blank">Clear</a>', the highly successful to-do app with flat and simple visual but powerful physics and interactions. By swiping the item right, user can mark complete the task. Swiping left is delete the task, pinch open to add an item and pinch close to fold the current task list. It might sound simple, yet it's physics is so great that when you are doing all these simple operations, you feel like you are manipulate a real object, you are throwing the completed task away like throwing your empty can of Coke to the dump. It relates to your feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>I still remember when the first time Apple released iPhone and introduced multi-touch, people are instantly amazed by the interactions without rationally knows why. Like Steve Jobs once put it in his keynote when demonstrating a multi-touch feature :" I can play this all day!'. As human-beings, we are sophisticated, we use our brains, we developed science. But most of the times, we aren't that smarter when it comes to our emotion. We fall in love, get hurt, heal through it, and do it again. That just how emotion works. It is sticky and always comes back. No wonder after Path first announced their Stickers and In-app shop, they said the first week it brings in more money than all the money the company has ever earned before. No wonder Facebook is following suit.</p>
