It has been a month since I chose Yahoo! Weather app as my default weather app on my iPhone. I liked the UI style of the app, simple, information matter on the front and center and the pretty Flickr local scenery photos, all with good touch. After WWDC 2013, it turns out that this app fits right into the [new iOS design](http://linwangge.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/what-exactly-apple-did-with-ios-7/). Is Yahoo!'s designers THAT good? Or they can see into the future?

The question became very obvious right after I delve myself into Apple's 'out-of-the-oven' Mobile Human Interface Guideline (can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/ios7/), need to have developer account to access):

Since iOS default weather app actually use Yahoo weather, I think designers in both companies must have talked before releasing their version of the weather app. Good for Yahoo! I'd say. And maybe in the future if we want to get a sneak peek into iOS changes, we could pay a bit more attention to Yahoo's weather app?
